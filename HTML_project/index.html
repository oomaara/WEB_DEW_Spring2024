            <h2>Tallinas street 23</h2>
            <p>"A small rental house, this building stands as a notable example of early ornamental Art Nouveau style. 
                Construction began in 1901 based on the designs of architect Konstantins Pēkshens (Konstantīns Pēkšēns), featuring a blend of 
                traditional eclectic elements like pilasters and sandriks. During construction, Eugene Laube (Eižens Laube), then an 
                architecture student, extensively transformed the narrow facade, characterized by its three windows on each floor. 
                The composition emphasizes color and texture contrast, utilizing various materials such as red brick, light or 
                dark plaster, metal, and natural slate."</p>

            <h2>Skolas street 3</h2>
            <p>"Vecrīgas" Complex at the Riga 700th Anniversary Exhibition in Riga, 1901.</p>
            <p> A four-story brick residential building designed by architect August Reinberg in 1905, 
                it served as the personal residence of the architect, constructed according to his design. 
                In the asymmetric composition of the street facade, various elements of romanticized historical 
                styles and Art Nouveau architectural elements are harmoniously balanced. The side facade facing the 
                garden is adorned with the inscription "Arbeit ist des Bürgers Zierde" ("Work is the ornament of citizens")."</p>
