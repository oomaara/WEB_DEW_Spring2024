//since it is kind of painful to remember to increment or decrement the loop variable
//for loops have been added to many programming languages they are more concise and less error prone

//Philosophically while loops should be used only when we do not know how many iterations we need
//for example we might get some user input or we might be reading from a file or a network and something might change
//for loops should be used when we know how many iterations we need

//for loop syntax
//for (start; stop; step) { code block }
//start is executed only once at the beginning
//stop is checked before each iteration
//step is executed after each iteration

//for loop is a combination of while loop and incrementing the loop variable

for (let i = 100; i < 103; i++) { //we can declare i in the for loop itself
    console.log("For loop iteration", i);
}
//after iteration the loop i is not available!! 
//older versions of JavaScript would have made it available
//in other words i went out of scope - the scope of loop variable is only inside the loop
//this is a GOOD thing because we do not want to accidentally use the loop variable outside of the loop

console.log("After for loop i is", i); //this will show the OTHER i not the one from for loop
//if we did not have other i it would be an error

//lets use i again but now we will count down by 2
for (let i = 10; i >= 0; i -= 2) {
    console.log("For loop iteration", i);

//again i is not available here UNLESS we have it declared outside of the loop
